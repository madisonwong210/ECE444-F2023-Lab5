Test driven development is a common method of software development. It is good because the tests guide the development, which results in simple code that does only what it needs to. This also results in a modular design that effectively documents the code and by nature has a high test coverage leading to a decrease in debugging efforts. On the other hand, TDD can be a slow process and tests must be constantly maintained and updated as requirements are changed.
